Firstly, we load necessary library *tidyverse* for Problem 1 and 2.

# Problem 1

## *1.1 Load Penguins Dataset*

We load the “penguins” dataset from the package “palmerpenguins”.

## *1.2 Description of the Penguins Dataset*

The penguins dataset contains data on three penguin species (Adelie,
Gentoo, Chinstrap), which were collected from 3 islands (Torgersen,
Biscoe, Dream) between 2007 and 2009. The other important variables
include bill length (bill_length_mm), bill depth (bill_depth_mm),
flipper length (flipper_length_mm) and body mass (body_mass_g). This
dataset consists of 344 rows and 8 columns. And the mean flipper length
of the penguins is 200.9152047 mm.
