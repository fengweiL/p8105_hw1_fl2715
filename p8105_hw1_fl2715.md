Firstly, we load necessary library *tidyverse* for Problem 1 and 2.

# Problem 1

## *1.1 Load Penguins Dataset*

We load the “penguins” dataset from the package “palmerpenguins”.

## *1.2 Description of the Penguins Dataset*

The penguins dataset contains data on three penguin species (Adelie,
Gentoo, Chinstrap), which were collected from 3 islands (Torgersen,
Biscoe, Dream) between 2007 and 2009. The other important variables
include bill length (bill_length_mm), bill depth (bill_depth_mm),
flipper length (flipper_length_mm) and body mass (body_mass_g). This
dataset consists of 344 rows and 8 columns. And the mean flipper length
of the penguins is 200.9152047 mm.

## *1.3 Scatterplot*

In this part, we make a scatterplot of *‘flipper_length_mm’* vs
*‘bill_length_mm’*. First, to avoid errors caused by missing values
during plotting, we remove the observations with missing data from the
dataset. We use flipper length (mm) as the y-axis and bill length (mm)
as the x-axis to create a scatter plot, and we use different colors to
distinguish between different penguin species. In this way, we obtain
the following scatter plot and named it *‘Scatterplot of Flipper Length
vs Bill Length of Penguins’*.

## *1.4 Export the Plot*

Finally, we export the above scatterplot to our project directory.

# Problem 2

## *2.1 Create the data frame*

We create a data frame that satisfies the requests for problem 2.
Firstly, for the reproducibility of the code, we set the seed as 1234.
Variable names are defined as *‘normal_sample’*, *‘logical_vector’*,
*‘character_vector’*, *‘factor_vector’* for the variables random sample,
logical vector, character vector, and factor vector respectively. A part
of this dataframe is as follows.

    ##   normal_sample logical_vector character_vector factor_vector
    ## 1    -1.2070657          FALSE                a        Level1
    ## 2     0.2774292          FALSE                b        Level2
    ## 3     1.0844412          FALSE                c        Level3
    ## 4    -2.3456977           TRUE                d        Level1
    ## 5     0.4291247           TRUE                e        Level2
    ## 6     0.5060559          FALSE                f        Level3

## *2.2 Compute Means*

We use the pull funtion to calculate the means of variables. The results
shows that the *‘normal’* and *‘logical’* variable work, but the
*‘character’* and *‘factor’* varibale do not work.
